# Dynamic Web Apps Challenge 13

## Project Summary

This project involves working with arrays and array methods in JavaScript. It includes exercises to manipulate arrays, iterate over array elements, and perform various transformations using array methods such as `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you'll need a JavaScript runtime environment such as Node.js.

## Code

The code for this project is organized into two sections: the first section works with arrays of provinces and names, and the second section works with an array of products.

---

## Section 1:

### Exercise 1

Using the `forEach` method, log each name in the `names` array to the console.

### Exercise 2

Using the `forEach` method, log each name along with its matching province from the `provinces` array to the console.

### Exercise 3

Using the `map` method, convert all province names in the `provinces` array to uppercase and log the new array to the console.

### Exercise 4

Using the `map` method, create a new array that contains the number of characters in each name from the `names` array. Log the resulting array to the console.

### Exercise 5

Using the `sort` method, sort the `provinces` array alphabetically and log the sorted array to the console.

### Exercise 6

Using the `filter` method, remove all provinces from the `provinces` array that contain the word "Cape". Log the number of remaining provinces to the console.

### Exercise 7

Using the `map` and `some` methods, create a boolean array that indicates whether each name in the `names` array contains the character "S". Log the resulting array to the console.

### Exercise 8

Using only the `reduce` method, create an object that indicates the province of each individual from the `names` and `provinces` arrays. Log the resulting object to the console.

---

## Section 2 (Additional Exercises):

### Exercise 9

Given the `products` array, use the `forEach` method to log each product name to the console.

### Exercise 10

Using the `filter` method, filter out products from the `products` array that have a name longer than 5 characters. Log the resulting array to the console.

### Exercise 11

Using both the `filter` and `map` methods, convert the string prices to numbers and remove products from the array that do not have prices. Then, use the `reduce` method to calculate the combined price of all remaining products. Log the total price to the console.

### Exercise 12

Using the `reduce` method, concatenate all product names from the `products` array into a single string separated by commas. Log the resulting string to the console.

### Exercise 13

Using the `reduce` method, calculate both the highest and lowest-priced items from the `products` array. Log the names of the highest and lowest-priced items as a string to the console.

### Exercise 14

Using only `Object.entries` and `reduce`, recreate the `products` object with modified keys. Change the key "product" to "name" and "price" to "cost". Log the resulting object to the console.

## Conclusion
That concludes the summary of the project. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of working with arrays and array methods in JavaScript.
